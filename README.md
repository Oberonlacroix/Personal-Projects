A few projects to demonstrate Python ability:

- NBA_Statistics: Web scraping, writing to a file(CSV) and data visualization
- fitness_protocol: Object Oriented Programming
- exercise_generator: Procedural Programming

Work to be done:
  - Improved error handling
  - Adding Further complexity to training programme functions
  - Add lists/dicts to store class instances
  - Accomodate for longer training programmes
  - Unit testing
